Diversified Italian Cultures is a project to create more unique cultures in Italy, especially for 1066 and later start dates.
Until modern times, there was no real concept of a unified Italian culture, as each region had distinct cultures and histories. 
Basegame CKIII has 4 cultures to represent the distinct Italian regions, but ultimately this project seeks to break down these 4 major groupings into ones that better reflect
the geographical subdivisions of Italy. As much as possible, I will use academic sources for names that existed in the medieval age.

A Note on Languages and Names:  
	There was and is a diversity of dialects in Italy. Dialects, crucially to this project, are not accents or derivations of one language. Rather, they are entirely distinct languages that are significantly related to one another either
	linguistically or geographically. In Italy, there is much debate at how related many of these dialects are. For example, Piedmontese shares a history with Catalan, Occitan, and French that has shaped it such that it is likely
	more similar linguistically (and geographically) to those languages than to Sicilian, which has an entirely different history. With this in mind, the grouping of languages into an "Italian" category in CKIII is a bit arbitrary.
	This is something that can be addressed in the future, but for the present moment the focus is on fleshing out dialects so that they actually exist in-game, and once that is accomplished, maybe reorganizing culture categories can occur.

	Names are difficult due to lack of source-material in dialect. Most names recorded in this time period were written in Latin. Thus, while someone in Milan, Venice, Florence, Rome, and Naples may spell their version of "John"
	differently (and it is that difference I am interested in!), documents may record them in all places as Iohannes, the Latin form. This is similar in surnames, where many names are Latinized and put in the Latin ablative form,
	which further distorts how they might *actually* call themselves in speech. In cases where only the Latin form is available, I have taken liberty to use modern spellings in dialect and sometimes the Latin word. Neither of these
	are perfect forms of what they actually called themselves, but this the best way to infer it. Also, for the sake of fun, I wouldn't include a name list of the 4 names in dialect recorded from medieval times, as that would make for
	some pretty repetitive character names. 

	I've included here the sources for each cultures. Due to their nature, cities with republican governments of some form had more names recorded, as they needed registers of 
	citizens who could vote and hold office. This also caused a need for more surnames. Therefore, places like Venice and Florence have more diversity in names (especially Florence!).

	Changelog
Version 1.0:
  - Added Toscano culture in Duchy of Pisa and Tuscany with unique name list
  - Modified localization of Italian cultures to reflect Italian spellings
  - Modified historical characters to be Toscano culture if held land in Tuscany unless specifically known to be of non-Tuscan origins.
  - Added new dynasties according to Florentine surname records
  - Added a few new Sicilian names (more to come)
  - Updated 00_names so that new names register as equivalents to others (e.g. Adamo now registers as equivalent to Adam; Benedetto to Benedict)

Version 1.1:
  - Added Venetian (VÃ¨neto) culture in Duchy of Friuli, Duchy of Verona, and Kingdom of Venice
  - Reworked Friulian/NE Italian title histories to change Franconian lords to historically accurate Frankish lords. 
  - Added Lombard (Latin) culture + Renamed Germanic Lombards to Langobards
  - Reworked Italian ethnicities to better reflect the occurence of blond/red hair and blue eyes in Northern and Central Italy. Also, Langobards now look Germanic instead of Mediterranean (as genetic evidence suggests)
  - Reworked Northern Italian history to reflect Frankish/Germanic origins of some Italian dynasties (Obertenghi and Bonifazi, others)
  - Added Piedmontese, Emilian, Romagnan, and Ligurian cultures and histories
  - Updated Italian histories to reflect Frankish/Langobard rule that historically continued into 1066
  - Reworked Italian mercenary bands to reflect Italian free companies

Version 1.2:
  - Added "Pugliese" culture for Southern Italy outside of Sicilian. Based on the "volgare pugliese" from medieval sources, a broad dialect covering southern Italy.
  - Updated for Version 1.3
  - Added simple culture change events for the spread of Pugliese and Sicilian cultures in their proper locations
  - Localized character designer so that Northern, Central, and Southern Mediterranean ethnicities are now selectable in the character designer
  - Add "Romanesque" culture to mimic a baseline post-Roman culture to splinter off into regional dialects. 
  - Add events to dynamiclly splinter Romanesque and for Pugliese and Sicilian to spread naturally.

Version 1.3:
  - Add restoration of the Western Roman Empire decision.

Version 1.4:
  - Updated names_00 for name compatibility between cultures (still WIP, but got a good number done)
  - Update Romanesque culture with unique names and surnames for pre-split cultures
  - Minor bugfixing and probability tweaking

Future Plans:
  - Corsican culture
  - Edit cultural innovations so that different Italian cultures can move down different Innovation tracks based on their histories
  - Adjust historical characters accordingly
  - update names_00 so that new names are matchable
  - Localize duchies and kingdoms for each culture
