Diversified Italian Cultures is a project to create more unique cultures in Italy, especially for 1066 and later start dates.
Until modern times, there was no real concept of a unified Italian language and culture, though there was a sense of a shared Roman heritage. This mod changes the Italian peninsula so that regional Italian diversity is represented in terms of language groups, which more-or-less coincide with regional variation in traditions, cuisine, etc.

Current features:
- Removes Cisalpine and Italian cultures from map
- Adds 9 new cultures to the Latin group, resulting in 11 total
- Updates character and dynasty histories so that landholders and major dynasties have proper culture
- Adds 3 ethnicities to give variation in appearance between Northern, Central, and Southern Italians.

Future plans: 
- Events related to specific Italian regions/cultures
- Unique innovations to certain Italian cultures
- Localization of Italian names and titles into vernaculars
- Rework 867 start (currently, only 1066 is fleshed out)
- Cultural genesis events (for 867 start)
